Code availability and reproducibility for Guillen et al. 2021

Over all this project highlights two snakemake workflows to recreate the genomic and drug screening dataset for the following manuscript, "A breast cancer patient-derived xenograft and organoid platform for drug discovery and precision oncology" by Guillen et al. 2021. I'm one of the co-authors of this project and we made it to publication so I'm providing the code that I used to generate the foundation figures for these two sets of analysis. Many of these figures were "touched up" in Adobe illustrator but the majority of the condent is there. 

In each of the directories I provide a snakemake workflow that executes the commands. Data for this project will not be stored in this GitHub Repo. Your job is to find those files and pull them in here. Some of the publically available data that I've trimmed (say driver mutatation data from TCGA files, or other gene lists are provided here) your job is to get permission from dbGap to pull in the relevant data and then it should run.... (We'll see)
